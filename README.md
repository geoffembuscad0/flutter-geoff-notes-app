# 🚀 Flutter Starter Kit

Because why start from scratch when you can start with awesomeness? 🎯

A carefully crafted Flutter starter template that save you from the boring setup stuff. You know, the stuff that makes you go "ugh, not again!" 😫

# 🛠 Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (we're rocking version 3.27.1 🎸)
- FVM (Flutter Version Management) - because we're fanc like that
- A cup of coffee ☕️ (or tea 🫖, we don't judge)

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Using FV (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter_starter_kit.git
cd flutter_starter_kit
fvm use 3.27.1
fvm flutter pub get
```

### Without FVM

```bash
# Check your Flutter version
flutter --version

# If not on 3.27.1, upgrad Flutter
flutter upgrade

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter_starter_kit.git
cd flutter_starter_kit
flutter pub get
```

## 🔑 Environment Setup

This app reads its Supabase credentials at compile time using `--dart-define-from-file`, so you need to create an `env.json` file in the project root (next to `pubspec.yaml`).

1. Copy the example file:

```bash
cp env.example.json env.json
```

2. Fill in your Supabase values:

```json
{
  "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project-ref.supabase.co",
  "SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY": "your-publishable-anon-key"
}
```

3. Run the app with the file:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json
```

The same flag is needed for builds:

```bash
flutter build apk --dart-define-from-file=env.json
flutter build web --dart-define-from-file=env.json
```

### VS Code

Add this to `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "geoff-notes-app",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "args": ["--dart-define-from-file=env.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Android Studio

Run > Edit Configurations > **Additional run args**:

```
--dart-define-from-file=env.json
```

> ⚠️ Without this flag the app throws `Bad state: Missing Supabase configuration`. Changes to `env.json` need a full restart; hot reload won't pick them up.

# 🏛 Architecture

This project uses a hybrid architecture combining aspects of MVC and Provider patterns for state management.

### 📱 Application Layers

#### 1. Presentation Layer (`lib/presentation/`)

- **Screens**: UI components and screen logic
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components
- Each screen can have its own widgets folder

#### 2. State Management (`lib/core/notifiers/`)

- **Notifiers**: Provider state management classes
- **States**: Immutable state classes

Example:

```dart
core/notifiers/
├── auth/
│   ├── auth_notifier.dart    # Auth state logic
│   └── auth_state.dart       # Auth state model
└── theme/
    ├── theme_notifier.dart   # Theme state logic
    └── theme_state.dart      # Theme state model
```

#### 3. Data Layer (`lib/core/`)

- **APIs** (`apis/`): API endpoints and network calls
- **Models** (`model/`): Data models and serialization
- **Services** (`services/`): Business logic and services

### 🔄 State Management Flow

```
UI (Screen) → Notifier → State → UI Update
    ↑          ↓
    └── API Services
```

**Flow Details:**

- Screens dispatch actions to Notifiers
- Notifiers handle business logic and update States
- States are immutable and represent UI data
- Services handle external data operations
